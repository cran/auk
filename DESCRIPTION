Description: Extract and process bird sightings records from
    eBird (<http://ebird.org>), an online tool for recording bird
    observations.  Public access to the full eBird database is via the
    eBird Basic Dataset (EBD; see <http://ebird.org/ebird/data/download>
    for access), a downloadable text file. This package is an interface to
    AWK for extracting data from the EBD based on taxonomic, spatial, or
    temporal filters, to produce a manageable file size that can be
    imported into R.
